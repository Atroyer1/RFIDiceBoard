Hardware errors:

Swiss cheese in the battery charger
Professor John Lund had issues placing the 4 pin BGA linear regulator so a SOT-23-5 was used instead
The low-side NMOS to connect the battery ground to the circuit ground has mis-labeled pins for the NMOS's that WWU has to offer
USB-C communication does not seem to work
UART output for debugging was never pinned out (would make debugging a lot easier)
TFT screen Chip Select pin is disconnected whilst the TFT screen's SD Card chip select pin is connected. These two should be swapped.
Power switch and the JTAG connector are dangerously close together
Capacitor for the low-voltage supervisor is unecessary and caused undesired oscillitory behavior
3 Volt ADC voltage reference IC is mis-pinned
C20 is the wrong size for the tantulum capacitors that WWU has to offer
The pinout for the RFID reader and the TFT display could use silk screen labeling


Andy Recommends for other projects:
Make sure to recommend a UART output for debugging. Specifically the same UART output that the PICO uses for Picoprobe
